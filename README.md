# Stopwatch in Python
I think it is very important to control time nowadays. Therefore , checking how long I have been working through a browser with a stopwatch with a .html extension that I made while working offline sometimes increased my desire to be online again . And I took a little surf at the internet and consulted the documentation on how to use it on my windows 8.1 operating system and discovered this tkinter module, this class library with so many libraries in it, I think is awsome. I am open to the advice of people who have mastered this module :) and if we have junior developers, I wish this document to be a source of light for them
